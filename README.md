#PHP Random dice throw generator

This is a simple PHP project where a user can choose how many dices they are going to throw and how many sides the dice have. 
Got the idea from DevProjects https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/random-number-generator-web-app-bz042v8kll.

To run the app I used:
```
php -S localhost:8000
```
